# API Routes

Just like with [NextJS API routes ](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes). Tuono API routes provide a solution to build a public API.

Any file inside the folder `src/routes/api` is mapped to the base url as `/api/*` and will be treated as an API endpoint instead of a page. They are server-side only bundles and won't increase your client-side bundle size.

## HTTP Methods

Tuono provides the following macros to define HTTP Request Methods

```rs
#[tuono_lib::api(GET)]
#[tuono_lib::api(POST)]
#[tuono_lib::api(PUT)]
#[tuono_lib::api(PATCH)]
#[tuono_lib::api(DELETE)]
```

API endpoints can only be accessed at the file level. This means that when making calls to the API, you need to use the name of the file as a parameter or identifier, rather than being able to access specific parts or contents within the file directly.

Create the following file under `src/routes/api/health-check.rs`

```rust
// ðŸ‘‰ src/routes/api/health-check.rs
use tuono_lib::axum::http::StatusCode;
use tuono_lib::Request;

#[tuono_lib::api(GET)]
pub async fn health_check(_req: Request) -> StatusCode {
    StatusCode::OK
}
```
- Run `tuono dev` and you can access the API endpoint `health-check` using a browser / curl command
```bash
# call api using curl command
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/health-check 
# returns a 200 OK response status
```
- NOTE: the `src/routes/` needs to be ommitted when calling the API
- NOTE: Ensure you name your file appropriately as the filename translates to the endpoint


## Sending a JSON response

When sending a response back to the client you can send a JSON response, this must be a serializable object. In a real world application you might want to let the client know the status of the request depending on the result of the requested endpoint.

Just like with Server side rendering, in order to serve JSON response, you define a struct.

The following example sends a JSON response with the status code 200 (OK) and the result of the async operation. It's contained in a try catch block to handle any errors that may occur, with the appropriate status code and error message caught and sent back to the client:

```rust
// ðŸ‘‰ src/routes/api/get-app-response.rs
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use tuono_lib::{
    axum::{        
        response::{IntoResponse, Response},
        Json,
    },
    Request,
};

#[tuono_lib::api(GET)]
pub async fn get_app_response(_req: Request) -> impl IntoResponse {
    
    // need to be defined within api handler
    #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
    struct MyResponse {
        pub status: String,
        pub message: String,
    }

    // need to be defined within api handler
    fn result<T: IntoResponse>(t: T) -> Response {
        t.into_response()
    }

    // ... business logic
    let my_response: MyResponse = MyResponse {
        status: "success".to_string(),
        message: "Hello, world!".to_string(),
    };

    let app_response = Json(my_response);

    result(app_response)
}
```
- Run `tuono dev` and you can access the API endpoint `get-app-response` using a browser / curl command
```bash
# call api using curl command
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/get-app-response
# returns a 200 OK response status with json payload
# {"status":"success","message":"Hello, world!"}
```
- NOTE: Any struct or trait implementations, must be defined within the api handler.

## Request with JSON payload

We are constantly working to better our API endpoint with seamless body parser. 

As of the current version of Tuono, you can parse the JSON payload by passing it as part of the headers.

The following example shows an api endpoint, which accepts a POST request method, with JSON
payload and returns a JSON response

```rs
// ðŸ‘‰ src/routes/api/post-create-todo.rs
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use tuono_lib::{
    axum::{
        http::StatusCode,
        response::{IntoResponse, Response},
        Json,
    },
    Request,
};

#[tuono_lib::api(POST)]
pub async fn create_todo(req: Request) -> impl IntoResponse {

    #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
    struct Todo {
        pub title: String,
    }

    fn result<T: IntoResponse>(t: T) -> Response {
        t.into_response()
    }

    let Some(req_header) = req.headers.get("Payload") else {
        return result(StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST);
    };

    let Ok(req_header) = req_header.to_str() else {
        return result(StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST);
    };

    let Ok(req) = serde_json::from_str::<Todo>(req_header) else {
        return result(StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST);
    };

    result(Json(req))
}
```

- Run `tuono dev` and you can do a POST to the API endpoint `post-create-todo` using Postman / curl command

```bash
# call api using curl command
```bash
curl  -X POST \
  'http://localhost:3000/api/post-create-todo' \
  --header 'Accept: */*' \  
  --header 'Payload: {"title": "Rust essential book"}' # current way of passing payload
  # returns a 200 OK response status with json payload
  # { "title": "Rust essential book" }
```
